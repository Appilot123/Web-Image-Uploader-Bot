<h1 align="center">Web Image Uploader Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on automating real image uploads to websites using stealth browser automation. Unlike typical bot traffic that simulates page views, this system performs actual image uploads via form submission, mimicking real human behavior. Built for scalability, itâ€™s ideal for boosting user-generated content metrics or automating media contributions across multiple web platforms.

## Core Features:
- **Stealth Browsing with Human Behavior Simulation:** Built with Puppeteer and Playwright in headless (or visible) mode, with randomized wait times and form interactions.
- **Automated Image Handling:** Bots pull images from local folders or external storage and perform real uploads through HTML forms.
- **Massive Scalability:** Designed to simulate thousands of users concurrently using proxy rotation, fingerprint spoofing, and headless browser farms.
